# Lessons learned:
        # At one hour mark, lost all code due version control initation.
        # Did not save locally before trying to initate version control.
        # Lost:
                # import data
                # outline of research questions/sub-components
                # answers for all questions: 1 statistic, 2 graphs
        # How to prevent:
                # If forget to initate Git beforehand, save local first
                # "Open in new session" to not override
        # Took another 45 minutes to re-create and document
        
# To learn:
        # What is the difference between "R Script" and "R Project"?
        # Why does creation of a "new Project" initate options for version control and not other "new files"?
