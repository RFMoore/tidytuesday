# Semi-learned:
        # Better at reviewing the available variables, defining a research question, and breaking it down into smaller questions
        # Improved code structure: In line comments for new learning, two line breaks for sub-components, RESULTS highlighted
        # FUNCTION add_count: Creating a new summary variable, assigning it a name, and adding it to the main dataset
        # FUNCTION scale_x_continuous: Analyst defined axis major break
        # PACKAGES colour_brewer and viridis, they are beautiful defaults
        
                
# Need to learn:
        # How to use line breaks more effectively
        # Adding READ.md file within Git for new R scripts
        # More graceful ways to filter multiple variables beyond many ==
        # Although I was able to re-order the Friends characters into couples (from alphabetical), I was not able to apply the desired color scheme          (darker for men, lighter for female of red, green, and blue). Instead could do one or the other. Investigate how to target color scheme.
